# NCR-Search

The queue I work out of doesn't allow us to search the text within a tag. We can only search for Tag numbers, part numbers, and a few other useless options.

I built this tool to help me find previouosly worked on jobs using the text contained within so I can reference them if the same discrepancy occurs again. The jobs come to my queue and I save them in pdf form after working them or seeing someone else has worked them. 

My tool will iterate through the files looking for whatever keyword or phrase I type in and display all the tags that contain a match along with a few words before and after the search for context. The part number, and Tag number are displayed as a link to the folder containing the pdf file for easier access. 

There's nothing special here, just lets me quickly find what I am looking for.
